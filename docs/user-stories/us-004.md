# Word Bank Management

```# User Story
As a game host
I want to have a variety of words to play with
So that each game is different and interesting
```

# Acceptance Criteria
- User can select a topic from a list of available topics
- Randomly select a word for each game related to the chosen topic
- Ensure that the same word is not repeated in consecutive games
- 

# Implementation Notes
- Words are stored in a Word Bank (../../word-bank/es.yaml)
- Word file is structured by topics:
```
topics:
- topic1:
  title: "Title 2"
  words:
  - "word1"
  - "word2"
- topic2:
  title: "Title 2"
  words:
  - "word3"
  - "word4"
```
- TOPICS in gameLogic.ts are fetched from the Word Bank to display available topics titles to the user.
- WORDS in gameLogic.ts are fetched from the Word Bank based on the selected topic.
