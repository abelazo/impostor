# Start Game

```# User Story
As a game host
I want to click a Start button to begin the game
So that roles are assigned and the reveal sequence starts
```

# Acceptance Criteria
- Button only enabled when participants ≥ 2
- Randomly assign impostor roles
- Randomly select a word for non-impostors
- Navigate to first player's reveal screen

# Implementation Notes
- Use existing participant list to determine number of players
- Use randomization functions to assign roles and select words
- Ensure navigation to reveal screen is smooth and intuitive
- Update game state to reflect the start of the game
- Consider edge cases (e.g., odd number of players)
- Provide visual feedback when the game starts
- Ensure accessibility of the Start button
- Test the role assignment and word selection logic thoroughly
- Log relevant events for debugging and analytics
- Optimize performance for quick game start
- Design the UI to clearly indicate the game has started
- Implement error handling for any issues during game start
